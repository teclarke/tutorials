        "The task requires the following functions:\n",
        "- A ```login(...)``` function\n",
        "  * A text file storing authorised player details.\n",
        "  * Allows authorised players to continue.\n",
        "  * Flowchart:\n",

        "  \n",
        "- A six-sided ```dice(...)``` function\n",
        "  * A function that returns a random number between 1 and 6.\n",
        "- A ```score(...)``` function \n",
        "  * Each separate player has a separate score.\n",
        "  * The score is the total number of points for both dice rolls.\n",
        "  * The scoring rules are summarised as\n",
        "    - Add number rolled to score.\n",
        "    - If even, add 10 points.\n",
        "    - If odd, subtract 5 points.\n",
        "    - If both rolls equal, roll extra dice.\n",
        "    - Score always >= 0\n",
        "    - The highest score after 5 rounds (of 2 rolls each) wins.\n",
        "    - A tie results in a tiebreak of 1 roll; highest score then wins. \n",
        "- A ```gameplay(...)``` function\n",

        "  * There will be a results text file.\n",
        "  * Scores will be stored as \"name, score\".\n",
        "  * At the end of each game, the highest 5 scores are displayed.\n",
